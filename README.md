# Portfolio
This is a compilation of data visualization and analysis based on free-use datasets that I downloaded from Kaggle.
I've put the credits to the original project master inside the file

If something goes wrong when you open the file, please try to reload it. It may take several times to finally loaded.

For the COVID-19 EDA file, the viualization can't be shown on github because github doesn't support the ipython notebook. So if you may, please use the nbviewer.jupyter.org to fuly view the contents.

Thank you!
